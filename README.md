# Description
In this study, we investigated the factors that lead to the onset of type 2 diabetes, with particular emphasis on those related to lifestyle choices. For this purpose, datasets from telephone surveys were utilized and merged to create a new dataset. An exploratory data analysis was conducted to extract useful patterns. Subsequently, Random Forest models were developed to classify potential patients into Healthy and Diabetic categories, with a focus on achieving high recall, as the accurate identification of diabetic patients is crucial in the medical field. To address the issue of class imbalance, methods of data oversampling and data undersampling were examined.
